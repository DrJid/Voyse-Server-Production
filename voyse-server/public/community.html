        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 12, 2014</p>
        <p>
        These Community Guidelines state how you should conduct yourself when using Voyse.
        </p>
        <p> Voyse is about connecting intimately and having fun. Our goal in creating these rules is to accommodate the broadest range of self expression while balancing the need for Voysers to be able to use our service safely and enjoyably.</p>

<p>Don’t send people Voyses they don’t want to receive. Don't send people people Voyses if the Voyse is mean.</p>
        <p>
       We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Community Guidelines whenever you access the Services to stay informed about how you are expected to use Voyse.
        </p>
<p>The types of Voyses you should not send:</p>
        <div class="list-container">
            <ul>
                  <li>Voyses that invade someone else's privacy or personal space;</li>
                  <li>Threats or warninggs with the intent of causing fear or stress to someone;</li>
                  <li>Harassing someone or bullying someone;</li>
                  <li>Voyses that are used to impersonate other people-especially without prior knowledge or consent;</li>
                  <li>Voyses that will put your personal safety at risk; and</li>
                  <li>Hacking into another user's account.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
<p>Violating these rules may result in the removal of content, the suspension of your account and being prohibited from using Voyse in the future.</p>
